A data analyst bridges the gap between the business and the data.

Mae Mulligan, one of Accentureâ€™s Managing Directors, is the client lead for Social Buzz. She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project. Mae has scheduled a project kickoff call with the internal Accenture team for tomorrow morning.

About the Client: Social Buzz
Task for Accenture:
Client's Problem:Social Buzz has experienced significant growth recently and lacks the internal resources to manage it.

Accenture's Tasks:
1. Audit of big data practices
2. Recommendations for a successful IPO
3. Analysis of popular content

Task for Data Analyst:
Analyze sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

Objective: Provide an analysis of content categories, identifying the top 5 categories by popularity.

Task 2:
You won't always need all datasets to find your answers. The first step is to use this data model to determine which datasets are required to identify the top 5 categories with the highest popularity. After analysis, the necessary datasets are:

- Reaction Score (quantifies popularity)
- Content ID
- Reaction Types
- Content Type
- Category

Data Cleaning:
Clean the data by:
- Removing rows with missing values
- Changing data types where necessary
- Removing irrelevant columns

Consider the relevance of each column to the business question. If a column isn't useful, exclude it.

End result:Three cleaned datasets:
- Reaction Types
- Reactions
- Content

Data Modeling:
Merge these three tables to create a final dataset.

End result: One spreadsheet with a cleaned dataset and the top 5 categories.

Task 3: Data Visualization and Storytelling
Create a PowerPoint presentation using the provided template. Include:
- Pie Chart
- Bar Chart

Task 4: Present to the Client
Present your PowerPoint to the client, delivering insights from your analysis.
